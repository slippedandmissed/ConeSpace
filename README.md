## How to serve the application
- `npm start` : Serve the application without rebuilding. This will reflect changes in the node server but not the angular app.
- `npm run build` : Rebuild the angular application. This will reflect all changes.
- `npm run test` : Run angular tests.
- `npm run serve` : Just serve the angular app and not the node server. This is purely for testing the UI. Supports hot reloading.
